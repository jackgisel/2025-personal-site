## I've been side tracked

I thought I was going to start 10 months of problems in Jan of this year. But, instead an opportunity came up to work with a couple of friends on a pretty dope project. The project still has not launched yet, but we are close. Depending on how the launch goes, we will see if I will get back to 12 months of problems.
