						I'm a software engineer who loves building things and sharing what I learn along the way.
					</p>
					<p>
						I currently work at <strong>Apple</strong>. Before that, I had the opportunity to work at <strong>Ridgeline</strong> and <strong>Ascend</strong>, where I focused on building robust systems and solving complex engineering problems.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'm passionate about full-stack development, with experience across frontend and backend technologies. I enjoy working on problems that require thoughtful architecture and clean, maintainable code.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is my corner of the internet where I write about software, technology, and ideas that interest me.
